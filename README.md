[Programmable Realtime Unit](http://hackaday.com/2014/06/22/an-introduction-to-the-beaglebone-pru/) (PRU) assembler, disassembler, and debugger.

The PRUs in the AM335x SoCs used by the BeagleBone boards are sweet

communicating with programs running under Linux.

Unfortunately they do not have good tools, so I wrote this.
